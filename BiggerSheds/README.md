Expansion of the interior of the shed. Comes with 8 different versions with wallpaper and flooring and configurable through config.json 

- 8 different versions of the shed wallpaper and flooring ((default is stone)) 'CONFIGURABLE THROUGH A CONFIG.JSON'
- 4.5x larger interior

## Compatibility
- Requires Stardew (1.3.28 or higher), SMAPI (2.7 or higher) and Content Patcher (1.4 or higher)
  - **NOTE:** You should get the latest stable versions
- Should work in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer
  - For multiplayer, everyone should have the mod installed, it is not necessary but people who don't have the mod will see you walking out of bounds
**KNOWN ISSUES**
- Due to limitations, the original wallpaper and flooring may overlap 1/4 of the shed. You can make it match by changing the wallpaper/flooring to match the unchangeable expanded room wallpaper/flooring
